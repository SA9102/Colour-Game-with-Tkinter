# Colour-Game-with-Tkinter
This is a simple program in which a colour name is displayed, and is coloured with a particular colour. The user must click the button that corresponds to the colour of the text. Each time a button is pressed, a (supposedly) different text is displayed with a colour to it. Points are earned with every correct guess. The user must earn as many points as possible for 30 seconds.

The 'Incorrect' sound is made by me using ChipTone, by SFBGames.
